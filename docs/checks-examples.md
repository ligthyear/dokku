```

Following a deploy, dokku will wait `10` seconds before routing traffic to the new container to give your application time to boot up. If the application is not running after this time, then the deploy is failed and your old container will continue serving traffic. You can modify this value globally or on a per-application basis:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_DEFAULT_CHECKS_WAIT=30
dokku config:set <app> DOKKU_DEFAULT_CHECKS_WAIT=30
```

You can also choose to skip checks completely on a per-application basis:

```shell
dokku checks:disable <app>
```

Dokku will wait `60` seconds before stopping the old container so that existing connections are given a chance to complete. You can modify this value globally or on a per-application basis:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_WAIT_TO_RETIRE=120
dokku config:set <app> DOKKU_WAIT_TO_RETIRE=120
```

> Note that during this time, multiple containers may be running on your server, which can be an issue for memory-hungry applications on memory-constrained servers.

## Checks

If your application needs a longer period to boot up - perhaps to load data into memory, or because of slow boot time - you may also use dokku's `checks` functionality to more precisely check whether an application can serve traffic or not.

To specify checks, add a `CHECKS` file to the root of your project directory. The `CHECKS` file should be plain text and may contain:

  * Check instructions
  * Settings (NAME=VALUE)
  * Comments (lines starting with #)
  * Empty lines

> For dockerfile-based deploys, the file *must* be in `/app/CHECKS` within the container. `/app` is used by default as the root container directory for buildpack-based deploys.

### Check Instructions

The format of a check instruction is a path or relative URL, optionally followed by the expected content:

```
/about  Our Amazing Team
```

The `CHECKS` file can contain multiple checks:

```
/                       My Amazing App
/stylesheets/index.css  .body
/scripts/index.js       $(function()
/images/logo.png
```

To check an application that supports multiple hostnames, use relative URLs that include the hostname:

```
//admin.example.com  Admin Dashboard
//static.example.com/logo.png
```

You can also specify the protocol to explicitly check HTTPS requests:

```
https://admin.example.com  Admin Dashboard
https://static.example.com/logo.png
```

### Check Settings

The default behavior is to wait for `5` seconds before running the checks, to timeout the checks after `30` seconds, and to attempt the checks `5` times. If the checks fail `5` times, the deployment is considered failed and the old container will continue serving traffic.

You can change the default behavior by setting `WAIT`, `TIMEOUT`, and `ATTEMPTS` to different values in the `CHECKS` file:

```
WAIT=30     # Wait 1/2 minute
TIMEOUT=60  # Timeout after a minute
ATTEMPTS=10 # Attempt checks 10 times

/  My Amazing App
```

You can also override the default `WAIT`, `TIMEOUT`, and `ATTEMPTS` variables for the global dokku installation:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_CHECKS_WAIT=30
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_CHECKS_TIMEOUT=60
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_CHECKS_ATTEMPTS=10
```

If your application runs multiple processes (a background worker configured in your `Procfile`, for example) and you have checks to ensure that your web application has booted up, you may want to disable the default check wait time for that application to avoid the `10` second wait per non-web process:

```shell
dokku config:set <app> DOKKU_DEFAULT_CHECKS_WAIT=0
```

## Example: Successful Rails Deployment

In this example, a Rails application is successfully deployed to dokku. The initial round of checks fails while the server is starting, but once it starts they succeed and the deployment is successful. `WAIT` is set to `10` because our application takes a while to boot up. `ATTEMPTS` is set to `6`, but the third attempt succeeds.

### CHECKS file

````
WAIT=10
ATTEMPTS=6
/check.txt  simple_check
````

For this check to work, we've added a line to `config/routes.rb` that simply returns a string:

````
get '/check.txt', to: proc {[200, {}, ['simple_check']]}
````

## Example: Failing Rails Deployment

In this example, a Rails application fails to deploy. The reason for the failure is that the postgres database connection fails. The initial checks will fail while we wait for the server to start up, just like in the above example. However, once the server does start accepting connections, we will see an error 500 due to the postgres database connection failure.

Once the attempts have been exceeded, the deployment fails and we see the container output, which shows the Postgres connection errors.
